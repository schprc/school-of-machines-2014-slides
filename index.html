                        <p>
                            For the past 3 years we have been working together, creating art installations and VJ-ing, as well as working with commercial projects that usually involve graphic design, programming, projection mapping, creative coding and electronics.

                            We run a small digital media studio <a href="http://www.codebark.com/">CodeBark</a> and are also developing the <a href="http://cc4av.info">CC4AV</a> (Creative Coding for Live Audio and Visuals) platform that works as a placeholder for workshops and other activities that we have done in Helsinki, Riga and Helsingor (<a href="http://clickfestival.dk/">Click festival</a>) so far.

                            The CC4AV idea initialy has been developed under the transdisciplinary platform <a href="http://www.pixelache.ac/pixelversity/av-culture/">Pixelache</a> Helsinki in 2012, with the aim to gather together visual and sound artists, hackers, designers, creative coders, experienced performers as well as beginners and interested people to participate in open-source software/hardware workshops related to creative coding, intereractive art and audiovisual performance.

                        <h3>Multiple Meaning of Projection Mapping</h3>
                        <p>
                            The term <b><i>mapping</i></b> highlights the role of space in the context of visual art as this term includes a function – real time projections adjusted to spatial objects.
                        </p>
    
                        <small>
                            The term <i><b>mapping</b></i> is also used in the computer sphere, for example, aligning peripherals with software parameters. It is possible to write on a personal computer’s screen due to the mapping of the keyboard with software functionality.
                        </small>

                        <p>
                            <i><b>Projection mapping</b></i> or real time projections adjusted to spatial objects is a recently created set of electronic audio visual media methods which allows to surpass standard-size projections multiplying the picture, as well as to adjust the picture for different surfaces.

                        <h3>Why It Has Been Invented?</h3>
                        <blockquote><small>
                            The reason why the projection mapping technique was invented and developed further was a problem when there was no place for a screen at an event venue. The projector could also be put in a place somewhere in the room where the beam of light breaks partially on the ceiling, partially on one wall and plus on some other surface, thus being absolutely useless. There was no appropriate software at that time yet and specialists of the field worked out – if gamers had various advanced possibilities for using a room in 3D environment then VJs could use it dividing the room by walls and thus providing a more in-depth overview – getting beyond the classic rectangular screen.
                            <br><br>
                            In 2011 artists started using this method in their works and companies like Microsoft started experiments with it as a serious, progressive technology. Nowadays if you are skilled enough you can make your own app and use it in your work and share it with others.

                        <h3>How it can be categorized</h3>
                        <p>
                            Projection mapping can be subdivided into two basic types:<br><br>
                            <i><b>1) Projections meant for particular surfaces</b></i> <br>
                            <i><b>2) Projections adjusted to the surfaces</b></i> <br><br>
                            By first subtype we usually understand installations, large scale projections on architecture, stage design and objects of art, as this subtype does not include in itself texturizing free spaces. The video material is prepared so that it can be shown in one go. <br><br>
                            The second subtype is more experimental, suitable for real time performances and Vjing — the process of texturizing surfaces includes remixing samples, cutting out and adjusting fields to various surfaces.

                            This embeded device/computer is something that can reduce production costs of an interactive audiovisual installation or instrument that one can use for live performance. As the Raspberry Pi is so small, it can fit in one's pocket. You can have many visual and/or sound synthesizers, installations and there will be no worries about having too much computer-filled bags with you whereever you go.
