                            For the past 3 years we have been working together, creating art installations and VJ-ing, as well as working with commercial projects that usually involve graphic design, programming, projection mapping, creative coding and electronics.

                        <h3>Mapping</h3>
                        <p>
                            A new term <b><i>mapping</i></b> has appeared; a word which does not exactly define the new method. It highlights the role of space in the context of visual art as this term includes a function – real time projections adjusted to spatial objects.
                        </p>
                        <small>
                            The term <i><b>mapping</b></i> is also used in the computer sphere, for example, aligning peripherals with software parameters. It is possible to write on a personal computer’s screen due to the mapping of the keyboard with software functionality.

                        <h3>Projection Mapping</h3>
                        <p>
                            <i><b>Projection mapping</b></i> or real time projections adjusted to spatial objects is a recently created set of electronic audio visual media methods which allows to surpass standard-size projections multiplying the picture, as well as to adjust the picture for different surfaces.

                        <blockquote><small>
                            The reason why the projection mapping technique was invented and developed further was a problem when there was no place for a screen at an event venue. The projector could also be put in a place somewhere in the room where the beam of light breaks partially on the ceiling, partially on one wall and plus on some other surface, thus being absolutely useless. There was no appropriate software at that time yet and specialists of the field worked out – if gamers had various advanced possibilities for using a room in 3D environment then VJs could use it dividing the room by walls and thus providing a more in-depth overview – getting beyond the classic rectangular screen.
                            <br><br>
                            In 2011 artists started using this method in their works and companies like Microsoft started experiments with it as a serious, progressive technology. Nowadays if you are skilled enough you can make your own app and use it in your work and share it with others.

                        <h3>Generative Art</h3>
                        <p>
                            The term refers to any artistic practice within which an artist uses a certain system (such as language rules, software, mechanism) or any other procedural invention which is actuated by a certain degree of autonomy and results in a finished work of art or adds to it.
                        </p>
                        <small>
                            <i><b>Generative Art</b></i> is often used to refer to computer generated artwork that is algorithmically determined. But generative art can also be made using systems of chemistry, biology, mechanics and robotics, mathematics, randomization and more.

                            <i><b>Software Art</b></i> is a work of art where the creation of software, or concepts from software, play an important role; for example software applications which were created by artists and which were intended as artworks.

                            <b><i>Creative Coding</i></b> is an interdisciplinary field where programming is united to design. There is a possibility that other areas may be involved<br>(art, science-related spheres, etc.)

                        <p>
                            Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming languages such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max/MSP">Max/MSP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer">Quartz Composer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFrameworks">openFrameworks</a>.

                        <p>
                            This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as Live coding.

                            This embeded device/computer is something that can reduce production costs of an interactive audiovisual installation or instrument that one can use for live performance. As the Raspberry Pi is so small, it can fit in one's pocket. You can have many visual and/or sound synthesizers, installations and there will be no worries about having too much computer-filled bags with you whereever you go.
